# Therapy Session Simulator

Therapy Session Simulator is an interactive tool designed to replicate realistic conversations based on the principles of **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**. It aims to support mental health professionals, students, and individuals by simulating structured, evidence-based therapeutic sessions.

The simulator enables users to explore CBT techniques such as:

- üß† Identifying cognitive distortions
- üí≠ Challenging negative thoughts
- üéØ Practicing behavioral strategies
- üìù Guided conversational therapeutic interactions

By grounding simulated interactions in established CBT practices and literature, the tool offers a **safe, scalable environment** for training, education, and self-guided reflection.
